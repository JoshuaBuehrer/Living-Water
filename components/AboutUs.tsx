        This map is a testimony to the work the Lord is doing in our community.
        Each pin represents a member stepping forward in faith, being baptised,
        and becoming part of the family of God.

        As we journey together toward achieiving 100 baptisms by 2025, we give
        thanks to all those who have participated - if you have questions or
        would like to learn more about our mission, please don't hesitate to
        reach out!
